Water tanker Buddy is one solution to the problems faced by the remote villages in Rajasthan which suffer from water scarcity and often leads to the unethical supply of water resources which includes corrupt selling of water resources at a highly unfair price to the villagers.

A one-stop portal which provides access to government officials to assign/book the number of litres of water required or the number of specific tankers to bent to the remote areas which are prone to water resources. This portal provides the real-time tracking of assigned water tankers. This also ensures the right delivery of water-tankers.
These listed water-tankers will be a collaborative database from suppliers all around the state. 
There are different levels of inquiry for tankers availability. 
We also address a public redressal service for issues related to the requirement of Water-tankers. 
The booking process is very easy and efficient.

With every booking confirmation, each tanker location and status will be available through the Unique Identification number (UIN). This UIN is all you need to access any query related to Tanker location as well as it's driver details.
